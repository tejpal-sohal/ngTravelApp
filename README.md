#ngTravelApp

**Task**
Take the attached data set hotels.json and write a web page (or simple set of pages) to present the data.

The result set is reasonably large so we need to be be able to filter the data.

#Approach

The json set was very large and since there was the freedom of using whatever technologies to create the application I chose the following:

1. Angular JS
⋅⋅* due to its features to build single page applications very quickly and modules.
2. BootStrap
⋅⋅* for out of the box features such style and responsive.
3. JQuery
⋅⋅* For some minor smooth animations/transitions (although majority of the animations is taken care of ngAnimate).
